Hi I'm Arie! I'm a software engineer (and engineering manager) at Ninja Van, a logistic company in Singapore. I like to explore technologies and write about them at my personal blog. My focus is general software engineering, data engineering and natural language processing. Hoped you enjoyed my articles!
