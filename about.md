Hi I'm Arie! I'm a computer scientist and currently leading data team at Airy, an Indonesia accomodation startup focusing on budget travelers. I'd love to play around with jupyter notebooks / lab, so almost all written in this blog is based on jupyter. Aside from that I have also experience in Java, Ansible, Javascript (React.js). Hope you guys enjoy my writings!
