This is my personal choice for productivity tools, you may find these tools usefull but you may also find differently. I use ubuntu desktop and android phone, so my personal choices will based on these platforms.

## White Noise - Spotify
Since the family package subscription is quite cheap (around ~$7 at Indonesia) I use spotify to listen to music or to listen white noises while I work. Strangely I found myself choosing cricket sound at night, like [this one](https://open.spotify.com/track/2PTeWBhkoVfuaRZSreVDyf), probably because it simulate quite night sound perfectly.
