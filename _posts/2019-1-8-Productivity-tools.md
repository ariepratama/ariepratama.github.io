This is my personal choice for productivity tools, you may find these tools usefull but you may also find differently. I use ubuntu desktop and android phone, so my personal choices will based on these platforms.

# Personal Productivity
## Tea Time (Ubuntu)
Link package [here](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=teatime), github [here](https://github.com/paroj/teatime). A rather simple timer, if you wanted to say do [pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) I personally think this tools will fit just fine. However it does not have an automatic pomodoro scheduler, so you have to manually click "start timer" everytime.

## White Noises - Spotify
Since the family package subscription is quite cheap (around ~$7 at Indonesia) I use spotify to listen to music or to listen white noises while I work. Strangely I found myself choosing cricket sound at night, like [this one](https://open.spotify.com/track/2PTeWBhkoVfuaRZSreVDyf), probably because it simulate quite night sound perfectly.
